Baltimore and Ohio Helper App
=============================

This is a simple jQuery / HTML app to simplify the calculations and scorekeeping of playing [Baltimore and Ohio](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43307/baltimore-ohio) by Winsome Games. If you've played the game, you know there's a ton of math and not much transparency on players' scores.

Thanks to [HazMat](https://github.com/HazMatt/BandO-helper), who moved a lot of the game engine parameters into JS objects. I copied some of that information when I got this project started.
